# Object-Oriented Programming Features

Rust supports some object-oriented patterns but differs significantly from traditional OOP languages. This chapter examines how Rust implements OOP concepts like encapsulation and polymorphism through its type system, and demonstrates implementing the state pattern both traditionally and idiomatically in Rust.

Key topics:
- Objects, encapsulation, and inheritance in Rust
- Trait objects for runtime polymorphism
- State pattern implementation and trade-offs
- Type-based alternatives to traditional OOP patterns
