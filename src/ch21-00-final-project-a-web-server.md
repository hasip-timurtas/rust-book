# Final Project: Building a Multithreaded Web Server

Build a basic HTTP server from scratch demonstrating systems programming concepts.

![hello from rust](img/trpl21-01.png)

## Project Components

- **TCP connection handling** and HTTP request/response parsing
- **Thread pool implementation** for concurrent request processing
- **Low-level networking** without frameworks

**Production note**: Use `hyper`, `warp`, or `axum` for real applications.
**Implementation note**: We use threads rather than async/await to focus on concurrency fundamentals, though many async runtimes employ thread pools internally.
