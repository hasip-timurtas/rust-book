# Common Collections

Rust's standard library provides heap-allocated collections that can grow or shrink at runtime. The three most commonly used are:

- **Vector** (`Vec<T>`) - Dynamic arrays for storing values of the same type
- **String** - UTF-8 encoded text collections  
- **HashMap** (`HashMap<K, V>`) - Key-value mappings using hash tables

Each collection has different performance characteristics and trade-offs. This chapter covers creation, updating, and reading operations for each type.
