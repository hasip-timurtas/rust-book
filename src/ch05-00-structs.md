# Using Structs to Structure Related Data

Structs are custom data types that group related values. Unlike tuples, struct fields are named, providing better code clarity and type safety. This chapter covers struct definition, instantiation, methods, and associated functions - the primary mechanisms for creating custom types in Rust.

Structs and enums (Chapter 6) form the foundation of Rust's type system, enabling domain-specific modeling with compile-time guarantees.
