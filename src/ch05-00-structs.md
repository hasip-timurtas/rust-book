# Using Structs to Structure Related Data

Structs are custom data types that group related values with named fields. Unlike tuples, structs provide semantic meaning through field names and don't rely on positional access.

This chapter covers:
- Struct definition and instantiation syntax
- Associated functions and methods
- Ownership considerations with struct data

Structs and enums form the foundation of Rust's type system, enabling compile-time guarantees and zero-cost abstractions.
