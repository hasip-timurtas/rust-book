# Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes

Rust's generics provide compile-time polymorphism through abstract type parameters. This chapter covers three key concepts: generic types for code reuse, traits for shared behavior contracts, and lifetimes for memory safety guarantees.

You've already used generics with `Option<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `HashMap<K, V>`, and `Result<T, E>`. Now you'll learn to define your own generic types, functions, and methods.

## Removing Duplication by Extracting a Function

Before exploring generics, let's examine the pattern of extracting common functionality. Consider finding the largest number in a list:

<Listing number="10-1" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Finding the largest number in a list of numbers">

```rust,editable
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/listing-10-01/src/main.rs:here}}
```

</Listing>

To handle multiple lists without code duplication, extract the logic into a function:

<Listing number="10-3" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Abstracted code to find the largest number in two lists">

```rust,editable
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch10-generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes/listing-10-03/src/main.rs:here}}
```

</Listing>

The refactoring process:
1. Identify duplicate code
2. Extract into function body with appropriate signature
3. Replace duplicated code with function calls

This same pattern applies to genericsâ€”replacing specific types with abstract placeholders that work across multiple types.
