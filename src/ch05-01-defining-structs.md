## Defining and Instantiating Structs

Structs provide named fields for data grouping, offering better semantics than tuples when field order shouldn't matter.

### Basic Syntax

<Listing number="5-1" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="A `User` struct definition">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-01/src/main.rs:here}}
```

</Listing>

Instantiation uses key-value pairs in any order:

<Listing number="5-2" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Creating an instance of the `User` struct">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-02/src/main.rs:here}}
```

</Listing>

Access and mutation require the entire instance to be mutable:

<Listing number="5-3" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Changing the value in the `email` field of a `User` instance">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-03/src/main.rs:here}}
```

</Listing>

Functions can return struct instances as the last expression:

<Listing number="5-4" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="A `build_user` function that takes an email and username and returns a `User` instance">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-04/src/main.rs:here}}
```

</Listing>

### Field Init Shorthand

When parameter names match field names, use shorthand syntax:

<Listing number="5-5" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="A `build_user` function that uses field init shorthand because the `username` and `email` parameters have the same name as struct fields">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-05/src/main.rs:here}}
```

</Listing>

### Struct Update Syntax

Create instances from existing ones with selective field updates:

<Listing number="5-6" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Creating a new `User` instance using all but one of the values from `user1`">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-06/src/main.rs:here}}
```

</Listing>

The `..` operator copies remaining fields:

<Listing number="5-7" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Using struct update syntax to set a new `email` value for a `User` instance but to use the rest of the values from `user1`">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/listing-05-07/src/main.rs:here}}
```

</Listing>

**Ownership Note**: Struct update uses move semantics. If any moved field contains non-Copy data (like `String`), the original instance becomes unusable. Fields implementing `Copy` (like primitives) are copied, not moved.

### Tuple Structs

Tuple structs provide struct semantics with positional fields:

<Listing file-name="src/main.rs">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/no-listing-01-tuple-structs/src/main.rs}}
```

</Listing>

Different tuple struct types are incompatible even with identical field types. Access uses dot notation with indices: `origin.0`, `origin.1`, etc.

### Unit-Like Structs

Structs without fields are useful for trait implementations without data:

<Listing file-name="src/main.rs">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch05-using-structs-to-structure-related-data/no-listing-04-unit-like-structs/src/main.rs}}
```

</Listing>

### Ownership in Structs

Structs typically own their data using owned types like `String` rather than references like `&str`. References in structs require lifetime parameters:

<Listing file-name="src/main.rs">

<!-- CAN'T EXTRACT SEE https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/1127 -->

```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: &str,    // Error: missing lifetime specifier
    email: &str,       // Error: missing lifetime specifier
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: "someusername123",
        email: "someone@example.com",
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
```

</Listing>

Lifetimes are covered in Chapter 10. For now, use owned types to avoid complexity.
