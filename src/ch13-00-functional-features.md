# Functional Language Features: Iterators and Closures

Rust incorporates functional programming concepts including closures and iterators, both offering zero-cost abstractions with compile-time optimizations.

This chapter covers:

- **Closures**: Anonymous functions that capture their environment
- **Iterators**: Lazy evaluation for processing data sequences  
- **Performance**: Both compile to equivalent machine code as hand-written loops
- **Practical application**: Refactoring I/O operations using functional patterns

These features enable expressive, high-performance code while maintaining Rust's safety guarantees.
