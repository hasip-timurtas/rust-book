# Enums and Pattern Matching

Enums define types by enumerating possible variants, enabling type-safe state representation and exhaustive pattern matching. This chapter covers enum definition, the critical `Option<T>` type, `match` expressions, and the `if let` syntax for concise pattern handling.

Enums provide algebraic data types that eliminate entire classes of runtime errors through compile-time guarantees.
