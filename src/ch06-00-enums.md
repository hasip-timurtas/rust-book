# Enums and Pattern Matching

Enums define types by enumerating possible variants, enabling type-safe variant handling through pattern matching. This chapter covers:

- Enum definition and variant syntax
- The `Option<T>` enum as Rust's null safety mechanism  
- `match` expressions for exhaustive pattern matching
- `if let` and `let else` for concise single-pattern matching

Enums combined with pattern matching provide powerful abstractions for modeling domain data and eliminating entire classes of runtime errors.
