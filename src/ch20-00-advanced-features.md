# Advanced Features

Advanced Rust features for low-level control and systems programming scenarios:

- **Unsafe Rust**: Raw pointers, FFI, static variables
- **Advanced traits**: Associated types, disambiguation, supertraits  
- **Advanced types**: Type aliases, never type, DSTs
- **Functions/closures**: Function pointers, returning closures
- **Macros**: Compile-time code generation

Use when standard abstractions are insufficient for performance or interop requirements.
