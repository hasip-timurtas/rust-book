# Advanced Features

This chapter covers specialized Rust features for systems programming, performance optimization, and metaprogramming.

## Topics Covered

**Unsafe Rust**: Direct memory manipulation and FFI
- Raw pointers and manual memory management
- Calling C functions and implementing low-level optimizations
- When safety guarantees must be selectively relaxed

**Advanced Traits**: Sophisticated type relationships
- Associated types for cleaner generic interfaces
- Higher-kinded types and trait object design patterns
- Newtype pattern for zero-cost type safety

**Advanced Types**: Specialized type system features
- Type aliases for complex signatures
- Never type (`!`) for functions that don't return
- Dynamically sized types (DSTs) and unsized types

**Function Pointers & Closures**: Function-as-data patterns
- Function pointers vs closures performance characteristics  
- Returning closures and higher-order functions
- Zero-cost closure optimization

**Macros**: Compile-time code generation
- Declarative macros for pattern-based code generation
- Procedural macros for custom syntax and derive implementations
- Metaprogramming for eliminating boilerplate

## When to Use Advanced Features

These features address specific use cases:
- **Performance-critical code**: Unsafe blocks for manual optimization
- **Library APIs**: Advanced traits for ergonomic interfaces  
- **FFI & Systems Programming**: Unsafe Rust for hardware interaction
- **Code Generation**: Macros for reducing repetition

Most application code won't need these features, but they're essential for systems programming and library development.
