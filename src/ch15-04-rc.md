## `Rc<T>`, the Reference Counted Smart Pointer

`Rc<T>` (reference counting) enables multiple ownership of the same data by tracking reference counts. When the count reaches zero, the value is cleaned up. Single-threaded only.

### Multiple Ownership Problem

Using `Box<T>` with multiple ownership fails:

```rust,editable,ignore,does_not_compile
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-17/src/main.rs}}
```

```console
{{#include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-17/output.txt}}
```

### Solution with `Rc<T>`

```rust,editable
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-18/src/main.rs}}
```

`Rc::clone` increments the reference count without deep-copying data. Use `Rc::clone` instead of `a.clone()` to distinguish reference counting from expensive deep copies.

### Reference Count Tracking

```rust,editable
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-19/src/main.rs:here}}
```

Output:
```console
{{#include ../listings/ch15-smart-pointers/listing-15-19/output.txt}}
```

`Rc::strong_count` returns the current reference count. The `Drop` implementation automatically decrements the count when `Rc<T>` values go out of scope.

`Rc<T>` allows multiple readers but no mutable access. For mutable data with multiple owners, combine with `RefCell<T>` (covered next).
