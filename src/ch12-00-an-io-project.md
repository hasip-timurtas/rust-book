# An I/O Project: Building a Command Line Program

This chapter demonstrates real-world Rust application development by building a `grep` clone, integrating concepts from previous chapters.

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a command-line text search tool similar to `grep`
- File I/O and argument parsing
- Error handling and environment variables  
- Performance-conscious implementation
- Cross-platform binary output

## Skills Integration

**Applied Concepts**:
- Module organization (Chapter 7)
- Collections and string handling (Chapter 8)  
- Robust error handling (Chapter 9)
- Generics and lifetimes (Chapter 10)
- Comprehensive testing (Chapter 11)

**New Concepts**:
- Closures and iterators (preview of Chapter 13)
- Trait objects (preview of Chapter 18)

## Why CLI Tools in Rust

**Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions, compiled binaries
**Safety**: Memory safety without runtime overhead
**Deployment**: Single binary, no runtime dependencies
**Cross-platform**: Consistent behavior across operating systems

**Comparison to Node.js CLI tools**:
- No interpreter required
- Faster startup time
- Lower memory usage
- Static typing benefits

This project provides hands-on experience with systems programming patterns and professional Rust development practices.
