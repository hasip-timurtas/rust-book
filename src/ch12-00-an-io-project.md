# Building a Command Line Tool: grep Implementation

This chapter demonstrates Rust concepts through building a `grep` clone. The project combines:

- Code organization and module system
- Collections (vectors, strings) 
- Error handling patterns
- Traits and lifetimes
- Testing strategies
- Closures and iterators (introduced here, detailed in Chapter 13)

## Project Overview

We'll build `minigrep` - a simplified version of the Unix `grep` utility that searches files for text patterns. The tool will:

- Accept command line arguments (query string and file path)
- Read file contents
- Filter matching lines
- Handle errors gracefully
- Support case-insensitive search via environment variables
- Write errors to stderr, results to stdout

This implementation showcases Rust's performance, safety, and cross-platform capabilities for CLI tools, while demonstrating idiomatic patterns for real-world applications.
